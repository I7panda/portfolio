<p> My name is Hristofor Rumenov Mihaylov , I come from a town located in the center of my country. I'm from Bulgaria a country in the South of Europe. I was born on the 2nd of May 1991. I grew up there until I finished primary school then I moved to another city to study Fine Arts in the Academy. About 2 years after being in the academy my mother thought It's a good idea to bring me here in Belgium and study here.... at first I didn't like it one bit simply because no one spoke my language and secondly English was considered to be the language of the outsiders as I've learned from some people.I came here in about 8 years ago , I hated the weather soo much and to tell truth I still hate it ... too moody and too depressing , no wonder people leave every vacation they can so they can see some sun. Anyhow I came in 2007 and started learning the language for 1 year only. Then I was forced to go a grade lower than my initial planned grade, which was 5th by the standarts here. I lost 2 years of my life so I can fit in , 2 years I'm never getting back , all my friends finished Highschool and I was still 2 years behind with no prom what so ever like ...nada It pisses people off when there is no prom atleast me , it was supposed to be my happiest day of Highschool and there was nothing.... After I failed twice to pass, beause of "Language" reasons I finally passed and finished Highschool now I'm trying my best in the AP Univercity in the Graphics and Digital  Multimedia sector . God help me pass here ... There are still things I don't understand in class ... My dayli life is a mixture of drawing , gaming , talking , chatting in general just communicating and some hobbies here and there . I play guitar , 2 actually ...well not at the same time ofcourse :P electric and acoustic . I want to start plaing piano but its so damn hard I can only manage one hand ... he he . I like photography and drawing maybe thats why I got myself into Art in the first place I just like expressing myself when I draw or play the instrument. I like listening to a large variaty of music styles, its kinda impossible for me to stick with one style, if i like it then i listen to it , nothing to do with style. Those are the things I like on the other hand the things I hate are lying, cheating and being pressured or being put under pressure. I absolutely detest being pressured or being lied to!!! U lie to me u die in my eyes simple as that. I forgive hardly , almost rarely. I am a person who will help you out with everything I have. If I make a promise to someone then I make my life goal if I must, because a promise is a PROMISE!! Well that covers the general information about me oh! I forgot I hate spices any kind of spices and I love sweets !! If you are intrested please make sure to follow me on FB , Twitter and Youtube. Also my Gallery is free to be viewed at any time. If you have any commissions you can go to my Deviant Art and ask there :3 toodles ! </p>
